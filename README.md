Designing policies to best promote regulatory compliance in the face of limited enforcement resources is a common challenge for regulatory agencies. In this study, I worked on a team to explore these questions in the context of changes to Californiaâ€™s implementation of the Clean Water Act. In 1999, California introduced mandatory minimum penalties (MMPs) of $3,000 for each Clean Water Act violation. Using public water quality data released by EPA, we investigated the impact of these MMPs on wastewater treatment plants using a synthetic control method, as well as in-depth case studies of specific facilities.

This repo contains sample code I wrote or contributed to for the project, including: 
- SQL queries to clean and preprocess water quality data
- `scrape_facility_reports.py`, a python script for web-scraping facility data from the California State Water Board website
- `main.py`, a python script containing functions for data analysis
- Additional jupyter notebooks containing data exploration & analysis
